# Dev-Roadmap

This is a work-in-progress site initially made from [Brian Design's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nLTB_E6XAM) tutorial with React to practice responsive web design. I plan to refactor the code, switch the CSS to SCSS, and replace the content with my other WIP [Roadmap](https://github.com/timmybytes/roadmap) repo, and the two will likely be merged eventually. For now, this is just for my own reference, and the codebase is a mess, so you may want to come back later or check out Brian's tutorial for the basis of the project.
